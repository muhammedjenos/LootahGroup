                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LPF was established to provide the best quality produce and service to our customers, serving them with the finest produce either imported from Paris or Grown regionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lootah are pleased to be working with our European Partners Oakleaf who have been supplying the very highest quality restaurants and hotels throughout Europe and the Caribbean for the last 17 Years. We have three experienced and dedicated buyers working exclusively for us in Rungis Market in Paris. We have chosen to bypass intensive farming methods that ignore nature the sun and soil and insist on overwatering, consequently substituting flavor for Yield. Instead we offer regional produce enjoyed by the people who live where the farms are utilizing what Europeans have known for years. Just to keep everything very natural and simple.
                    </p>
